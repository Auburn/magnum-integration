/** @page building-integration Downloading and building integration libraries
@brief Guide how to download and build integration libraries for the Magnum engine.

@tableofcontents
@m_footernavigation

The integration repository provides integration of various math and physics
libraries with Magnum engine. They are not needed for essential usage, but it
might get handy if you want to use something other than builtin components and
seamlessly integrate them with the rest of the engine.

@section building-integration-packages Prepared packages

The easiest way to install Magnum Integration is to use one of the ready-made
packages for your platform of choice. See @ref building-integration-manual if
you want to have more control. Cross-compiling is very similar to
@ref building-cross "cross-compiling of Magnum itself".

@subsection building-integration-packages-vcpkg Vcpkg packages on Windows

Magnum Integration libraries are available as a [Vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg)
package. After setting up Vcpkg like described in the README, you can install
latest stable version of Magnum Integration with all its dependencies like this:

@code{.bat}
vcpkg install magnum-integration
@endcode

But often you may want to install the latest Git revision of all Magnum
projects instead:

@code{.bat}
vcpkg install corrade --head
vcpkg install magnum --head
vcpkg install magnum-integration --head
@endcode

This by default installs a 32-bit dynamic version of the package, you can use
@cb{.bat} vcpkg install magnum-integration:x64-windows @ce or
@cb{.bat} vcpkg install magnum-integration:x64-windows-static @ce to install a
64-bit (static) version instead. You can also use the `VCPKG_DEFAULT_TRIPLET`
variable to change the default --- see the
<a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg/blob/master/docs/users/triplets.md">Vcpkg triplet documentation</a>
for more information.

Note that just a subset of integration libraries is installed by default. To
opt-in or opt-out of additional features, you can use the following syntax;
feature names are simply names of CMake `WITH_*` options from the
@ref building-integration-features section but lowercase. See the
<a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg/blob/master/docs/specifications/feature-packages.md">feature documentation</a>
for more information.

@code{.bat}
vcpkg install magnum-integration[bullet]
@endcode

Packages installed using Vcpkg can be used straight away in Visual Studio ---
all you need to do is to @cpp #include @ce the headers you want, the
buildsystem will do all needed library linking and setup behind the scenes
automatically. <em>(Cool, isn't it?)</em>

@note If Visual Studio doesn't find the packages, check its verbose output, it
    might point to a mismatch of the triplet above or broken Vcpkg integration.

In order to make Magnum projects installed using Vcpkg available to CMake-based
projects, specify the Vcpkg toolchain file on the command line when invoking
CMake in a fresh build directory, for example:

@code{.bat}
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=C:/src/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
@endcode

If you want to pass additional flags to CMake, run @cb{.bat} vcpkg edit magnum-integration @ce
and edit `OPTIONS` in @cmake vcpkg_configure_cmake() @ce.

There are also Vcpkg packages for
@ref building-plugins-packages-vcpkg "Magnum Plugins" and
@ref building-extras-packages-vcpkg "Magnum Extras".

@subsection building-integration-packages-arch ArchLinux packages

In `package/archlinux/magnum-integration-git` there is a package for Git
development build. The package is also in AUR as
[magnum-integration-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/magnum-integration-git/).
It depends on @ref building-corrade-packages-arch "Corrade" and
@ref building-packages-arch "Magnum" ArchLinux packages.

There are also a few development packages for native builds, cross-compilation
for Emscripten, Android and MinGW or various sanitizer/coverage builds. See the
PKGBUILD files in the `package/archlinux` directory. They allow you to build
and install the package directly from source tree. Example usage:

@code{.sh}
git clone git://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration && cd magnum-integration
cd package/archlinux
makepkg -fp PKGBUILD # or any other PKGBUILD file
@endcode

In most cases the development PKGBUILDs also contain a @cb{.sh} check() @ce
function which will run all unit tests before packaging. That might sometimes
fail or take too long, pass `--nocheck` to `makepkg` to skip that.

Once built, install the package using `pacman`:

@code{.sh}
sudo pacman -U magnum-integration-*.pkg.tar.xz
@endcode

Edit the PKGBUILDs if you want to pass additional flags to CMake or
@ref building-integration-features "enable / disable additional features".

There are also ArchLinux packages for
@ref building-plugins-packages-arch "Magnum Plugins",
@ref building-extras-packages-arch "Magnum Extras" and
@ref building-examples-packages-arch "Magnum Examples".

@subsection building-integration-packages-deb Packages for Debian, Ubuntu and derivatives

The `package/debian/` directory contains all files needed for building Debian
packages. You need the @ref building-corrade-packages-deb "Corrade" and
@ref building-packages-deb "Magnum" Debian packages installed and in addition
also the `dpkg-dev` and `debhelper` packages. Building is easy, just change
directory to package root, link or copy the `package/debian` directory there
and run `dpkg-buildpackage`:

@code{.sh}
git clone git://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration && cd magnum-integration
ln -s package/debian .
dpkg-buildpackage
@endcode

This will compile binary and development packages, which will then appear in
parent directory. Install them using `dpkg`:

@code{.sh}
sudo dpkg -i ../magnum-integration*.deb
@endcode

If you want to pass additional flags to CMake or
@ref building-integration-features "enable / disable additional features", add
them to `dh_auto_configure` at the bottom of `debian/rules`. Watch out, as
indentation has to be done using tabs, not spaces.

There are also Debian packages for
@ref building-plugins-packages-deb "Magnum Plugins",
@ref building-extras-packages-deb "Magnum Extras" and
@ref building-examples-packages-deb "Magnum Examples".

@subsection building-integration-packages-gentoo Gentoo Linux ebuilds

Gentoo Git ebuild is available in the `package/gentoo` directory. Get the
@ref building-corrade-packages-gentoo "Corrade" and
@ref building-packages-gentoo "Magnum" Gentoo packages first and then build and
install Magnum Integration like this:

@code{.sh}
git clone git://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration && cd magnum-integration
cd package/gentoo
sudo ebuild dev-libs/magnum-integration/magnum-integration-99999.ebuild manifest clean merge
@endcode

If you want to pass additional flags to CMake or
@ref building-integration-features "enable / disable additional features", add
them to `mycmakeargs` in the `*.ebuild` file.

There are also Gentoo packages for
@ref building-plugins-packages-gentoo "Magnum Plugins",
@ref building-extras-packages-gentoo "Magnum Extras" and
@ref building-examples-packages-gentoo "Magnum Examples".

@subsection building-integration-packages-brew Homebrew formulas for macOS

macOS [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) formulas building the latest Git revision are
in the `package/homebrew` directory. Either use the `*.rb` files directly or
use the tap at https://github.com/mosra/homebrew-magnum. This will install the
latest stable version of Magnum Integration with all dependencies:

@code{.sh}
brew install mosra/magnum/magnum-integration
@endcode

But often you may want to install the latest Git revision of all Magnum
projects instead:

@code{.sh}
brew install --HEAD mosra/magnum/corrade
brew install --HEAD mosra/magnum/magnum
brew install --HEAD mosra/magnum/magnum-integration
@endcode

When installing from the `*.rb` files you need to install the
@ref building-corrade-packages-brew "Corrade"
and @ref building-packages-brew "Magnum" Homebrew packages first. If you want
to pass additional flags to CMake or
@ref building-integration-features "enable / disable additional features", edit
the `*.rb` file.

There are also Homebrew packages for
@ref building-plugins-packages-brew "Magnum Plugins",
@ref building-extras-packages-brew "Magnum Extras" and
@ref building-examples-packages-brew "Magnum Examples".

@section building-integration-manual Manual build

The source is available on GitHub: https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration.
Building the integration libraries is very similar to building Magnum itself.
See @ref building for additonal information about building and running tests,
cross-compiling and platform-specific issues.

@subsection building-integration-features Enabling or disabling features

Similarly to Magnum, the libraries are build as shared by default. If you are
developing for a platform which doesn't support shared libraries or if you just
want to link them statically, enable `BUILD_STATIC` to build the libraries as
static. If you plan to use them with shared libraries later, enable also
position-independent code with `BUILD_STATIC_PIC`.

Libraries built in the `Debug` configuration (e.g. with `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` set
to `Debug`) have a `-d` suffix, similarly to what is done when
@ref building "building Magnum itself".

By default no integration libraries are built and you need to select them
manually:

-   `WITH_BULLET` --- Build the @ref BulletIntegration "BulletIntegration"
    library. Depends on [Bullet Physics](http://bulletphysics.org/).
-   `WITH_DART` -- Build the @ref DartIntegration "DartIntegration" library.
    Depends on [DART](http://dartsim.github.io/).
-   `WITH_OVR` --- Build the @ref OvrIntegration "OvrIntegration" library.
    Depends on the [Oculus SDK](http://developer.oculus.com/).

Note that each [*Integration namespace](namespaces.html) documentation contains
more detailed information about its dependencies, availability on particular
platforms and also a guide how to enable given library for building and hot to
use it with CMake.

@section building-integration-doc Building documentation

The documentation for integration libraries is built as part of of the main
Magnum documentation. Clone the projects next to each other and continue as
described in @ref building-doc.

@section building-integration-ci Continuous Integration
